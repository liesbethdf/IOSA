\section{Introduction}

%The aim of the study is to measure the impact on employment of the changing international conditions in which the South African economy operates in the case of a low-carbon transition. %For example, a 2° scenario worldwide implies demand for coal will decrease. The South African coal sector can thus be impacted, both through a changed (lowered) export price as well as through lower export volume. When the demand and the profitability of a sector, in this case the mining sector, are expected to decrease, employment in the sector will follow the sector's trend.


This study seeks to evaluate from a macroeconomic perspective the effect on the South African economy of a global transition to a low-carbon economy. The study focuses on the transition risk --- i.e. the risk arising from the adoption of an economic apparatus on a world-wide scale that would make up a low-carbon economy --- due to external sources, outside of the influence of South African decision-makers. This external risk consists in the fact that the demand on the international market for certain goods exported and imported by South Africa, %and their price % on the international market, 
is impacted by a low-carbon transition and unanticipated at the time investments were made in assets to produce/transform exported/imported goods. 
A low-carbon transition of the South African economy itself is not considered here. In this aspect the present report follows the approach taken by the Climate Policy Initiative (CPI) who conducted an analysis of the external transition risk faced by South Africa taking a micro-economic, sectoral, approach. At times when judged necessary, risk is in CPI's analysis evaluated at the level of individual assets : for example, because for the coal-mining sector the effect of coal-export demand on the profitability of mines depends on the type of contracts with purchasers each mine has already concluded at present, a min-per-mine analysis is made. 

The present report differs from CPI's in that it approaches the issue from a macroeconomic perspective, %the opposite side of the scale at which the economy can be viewed. Conducting a macro analysis %of the same issue 
offering a complementary point of view on the conclusions obtained from the micro-analysis. To allow for maximum comparability between the results obtained from both studies, while the toolboxes used are considerably different, the scenarios analyzed with the toolboxes are as much as possible the same. 

Two scenarios are compared : a business as usual (BAU) scenario where current economic policy choices are assumed to hold for the period covered by the study (2108-2035), %it is not assumed that the world economy will make any specific effort to develop a low-carbon socio-technological system, 
and a 2 degrees (2DS) scenario where on the contrary choices are made resulting in the development of a low-carbon socio-technological system that allows to contain %The specific low-carbon scenario considered is one where the economic apparatus / adopts sociological and technological structure that allows 
global warming with a 50\% chance within the limit of 2°C with respect to pre-industrial times. Each of these scenarios implies distinct prospective export volume and/or price trajectories over the period under study for key sectors/commodities. The hypothesis for trajectories are obtained from CPI's models. Key export commodities are selected based on 1) whether export demand for them is different under BAU and 2DS and 2) whether they are important for the SA economy ; they are thermal coal, platinum and iron ore. A key imported commodity is crude oil, demand for which is satisfied by close to 100\% imports and of which the price on the international market might be lower under a 2DS versus under BAU. 

%This report proposes an analysis of the impacts of the adoption of a low-carbon  world-scale development of the economy on the South African economy from a macroeconomic point of view. This analysis complements the sector-, firm- and asset-level analysis conducted by CPI. The purpose of this complementary analysis is to evaluate whether the conclusions reached via two distinct methods are qualitatively similar. The two methods can in short be juxtaposed as follows : both on the micro and the macro level, the impact of changes to external conditions (export prices, export demand volumes) to which the SA economy is impacted is simulated/evaluated. For the goods exported by SA and identified as undergoing a significant change in demand in case of a low carbon trajectory followed by the world economy, CPI used scenarios for volume and price on the global markets under a 2DS and a BAU scenario. In the case of the micro analysis, the impact of these scenarios is evaluated on the economy on a sector, firm, and/or asset based level. The impacts on the individual units are then aggregated to obtain a figure representing the impact on the whole economy. The macro analysis follows the opposite route : the impact on the South African economy of the alternative demand scenarios for the main SA export goods that would be impacted by a world-scale low-carbon transition is evaluated on the level of the economy as a whole, from the macro economic point of view. From this economy-wide point of view, an effort is then made to pinpoint the observed effects on the macro-level to specific economic units (subsectors, firms). The two approaches are in a certain sense situated on the opposite side of the spectrum of how the economy can be described. 

%The impact on the South African economy is assessed if the world adopts a transformation of the economy compatible with a xx\% chance of keeping the raise of the average global temperature under 2°C. This impact is explored in detail by CPI taking a microeconomic approach. CPI identified the key sectors that would be impacted by a global 2DS scenario and analyzed for each of the main actors/firms making up those sectors the impact an external 2DS would have on them. 

%The development of a low-carbon economy on a worldwide scale, has implications for the quantities of fossil fuels used and, the demand for fossil fuels, specifically for coal, and for the demand for certain metals, etc. Thus, the nations that are providers, through export, of the primary commodities of which demand would be impacted by a low-carbon world-economy, will see there revenues impacted. 

\section{Method}

The specific issues under scrutiny in this study are the ones identified by the CPI study. Under a 2DS South Africa is expected to export less coal than under BAU. Secondly, the market price for crude oil, imported by South Africa, is expected to be lower under 2DS. In addition, the CPI analysis showed that lower revenues from exported coal might result in a higher domestic price. %for coal, which is used for electricity generation. 
%The impact of this second order effect will be looked at from the point of view of the macro analysis. 

%when the coal sector faces different demand for export purposes under both scenarios, the differential impact on the economy is not limited to the coal sector but extends to the sectors that sell intermediate inputs to the coal sector. The macroeconomic picture provided by the IOT allows to systematically evaluate the impact of the external scenarios throughout the economy, taking into account how each sector depends on others for its revenue.

The differential impact of export and import volumes and prices in BAU versus 2DS is not limited to %impact the growth and profitability  
the domestic sector doing the exporting and importing. The effect extends to the rest of the economy because commodities are made in value chains, linking industries through procurement %and supply 
relationships. The first will be referred to as the direct and the latter as the indirect effects. The indirect effects arise from two different mechanisms. The first is how the volume of output of a sector, of which goods for export are a part, determines the volume of inputs bought from others. %throughout the economy is via the inputs it uses, which contribute to total demand addressed to other sectors. 
If output doubles,  %, which includes exports, consumption by households and government and investment, 
the demand for inputs addressed to other sectors will react with the same order of magnitude. This effect can be substantial : in terms of employment, the number of jobs created indirectly, throughout the economy via demand for inputs, can be higher than the number of jobs created in the sector using the inputs. The second mechanism consists of how the price of the output of a sector, used as input by others, has repercussions on the profitability of other sectors and the price of the corresponding commodities. 

%The macroeconomic picture provided by the IOT allows to systematically evaluate the impact of the external scenarios throughout the economy, taking into account how each sector depends on others for its revenue.


The methodology here used for the analysis allows to take into account both direct and indirect consequences on the macro-level. The information needed to perform such an analysis is provided by input output tables (IOT). %These tables provide quantitative information on what inputs each sector uses from the other sectors and on how the output from each of the sectors is used.  It is based on the input-output table (IOT) of the South African economy. 
An IOT is a quantitative representation of the economy as a whole showing the inter-dependencies between sectors formed by the procurement relationships. %These inter-dependencies can be described in two ways, both based on the same fact : the goods produced by every industrial sector are used on the one hand for final uses, such as electrical appliances bought by households, and on the other hand used as inputs by other sectors. Examples of the latter are  This fact is described in the IOT firstly 1) by showing 
The IOT shows how the output of an industrial sector is used throughout the economy : final goods for export, investment, for consumption by households, government, as inputs for a number of other sectors and how much is exported. Inputs can be primary commodities such as coal or metal ores, processed goods such as steel or parts that can be assembled into machinery, etc. Consequently, the IOT also shows what inputs every sector uses produced by the same and other sectors. This latter fact can also be described by saying that the IOT shows how one sectors activity creates demand, and how much of it, to other sectors. Indeed, making cars out of steel generates economic activity and jobs in the steel sector. 

%The accounting equations represented in 
The IOT, in conjunction with sectoral employment data, can be used to estimate the number of jobs directly and indirectly generated by a given sector's activity. The table can then be used as the basis for creating a straightforward model to make estimates of how future developments in a sector's activity impact both GDP and the direct and indirect jobs the sector's activity generates.

%The method here used provides a way to make an estimate, when demand to a sector changes --- for example following the above scenario, due to decreased exports or lower export prices --- of what the impact on the whole economy  will be. Indeed, not only the sector that directly faces the changed conditions is impacted, but also the sectors from which this first sector uses inputs. In their turn, this latter set of sectors use inputs, and thus the changed demand they face impacts the sectors from whom they use inputs, and so forth. The initially changed export demand thus generates a change in the volume of production, and also in the price they face and their profitability, of a whole number of industrial sectors. The impact on employment will thus not be limited to the industrial sector directly concerned, but will spread to a certain extent throughout the economy. For every scenario, both the amount of jobs directly and indirectly generated by an industry's productive activity are estimated.

Also the CPI study looks into the impact on the value chain in which the identified key sectors are situated. For example, the demand for coal does not only impact the corresponding part of the mining sector, but also the actor, Transnet, providing the transport by rail of the coal to power ports, from where the coal is exported. However, the advantage of the present study is that it evaluates these indirect impacts in a systematic manner.

The methodology can be summarized as follows. The same price and volume trajectories for key export goods %impacted by a 2DS, 
evaluated on a micro-level by CPI, are evaluated on the macro level with the IO-model. The IO-model yields the difference in the impact of these export scenarios at the level of the economy as a whole between the BAU and 2DS scenarios. A distinction is made between the direct and the indirect impact. %, the former due to different final (export) demand and the latter being the impact due to the consequently different intermediate demands. 
These impact will be estimated both in terms of loss or gain in GDP or growth, and in terms of loss of jobs. Indeed, a key aspect of evaluating the impact of export scenarios on the economy is not only to evaluate the lost revenue, but also to evaluate which economic actors bear this cost. CPI makes a detailed analysis of how the costs are born between stakeholders (firms, the government), ... from a financial point of view and on jobs via ... In addition, the IO analysis allows for an evaluation of the impact on employment of the lost revenue. 


%The impact on employment is assessed of the external threats, as identified by CPI, facing South Africa under a 2DS, from a macroeconomic standpoint. 
%The effect on employment (and global cost to the economy) assuming the baseline scenario, which is IEA's New Policies Scenario (NPS), is compared with CPI's 2DS scenario. The 2DS is an adaptation of the IEA's SDS. 


\subsection{The input-output table}

An input-output table is a quantitative representation of the economy as a whole showing the inter-dependencies between sectors formed by their mutual procurement relationships. %These inter-dependencies can be described in two ways, both based on the same fact : the goods produced by every industrial sector are used on the one hand for final uses, such as electrical appliances bought by households, and on the other hand used as inputs by other sectors. Examples of the latter are  This fact is described in the IOT firstly 1) by showing 
The precise structure of an input-output table varies, %along with in line ith 
depending on the level of detail of the data collected. The more detailed the data, the heavier the data requirements. %The IOT is more detailed when the economy is disaggregated into more sectors, 
Figure \ref{IOT_basic} represents the structure of the IOT as supplied by the South African statistical agency (Stat SA). The first $n$ rows of the table show the $n$ industrial sectors into which the producing economy is disaggregated in their capacity as producers. The column the most to the right shows the total production or output $x_i$ for each of them. The columns represent the different agents, or institutional units, of the economy in their capacity as buyers. In each column is specified what amount they buy of each of the goods in the $n$ rows. The first $n$ columns are the $n$ industrial sectors, now in their role as buyers. The industries buy goods to use as intermediate inputs in their production process. Thus, this first $n \times n$ block in the IOT shows the industrial sectors in their buyer-seller relationships. The next columns, grouped under "Final demand" show what amount of each type of product is bought by the different agents as final product. These goods and services are bought as is, not as an input for the production of another product. The five types of final expenditure, are Consumption by households $c_i$ and government (Government expenditure) $g_i$, Exports $e_i$, Gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) $i_i$ and Changes in inventories $inv_i$. These first $n+5$ columns constitute total demand, for intermediate and final goods. The last column is "Imports" and specifies what amount $m_i$ of each type of good is imported. Imports are the second source of products in addition to domestic production. Demand is thus supplied to through domestic production and imports. By attaching a minus-sign to imports, the first $n+6$ columns add row-wise up to domestic output. Thus, the rows shows how the total output of each sector is used in the economy, or alternatively, where the demand for its good comes from.

\end{table} 


Column-wise, we can see what different goods each institutional unit is buying. The purchases by the $n$ industries reveal their production structure. For example, sector ... buys a lot of ... etc. 

A downside of the IOT in figure \ref{IOT_basic} is that it does not provide separate information on how domestic production and imports are used. Both are added to form a pool of total resources per type $x_i + m_i$, of which is the shown how much of the resources are allocated to what use ($z_{ij}$,$c_i$,$g_i$,$e_i$,$i_i$, $inv_i$). However, per type of use is not specified how much stems from domestic production and how much from importation. This is important, because the IOT will serve to create a model that will, among other things, respond to the question of how exports, which is final demand for the country in question, generate economic activity throughout the economy, via the procurement of inputs. If these inputs are imported, their production will not generate domestic jobs. It is when the inputs are domestically produced, that demand for them generates jobs and domestic added value. 

%For the intended analysis, the distinction between the uses made of imported versus domestically produced goods and services is important. Indeed, consumption of domestic output creates economic activity, and thus jobs and value, within the domestic economy. In contrast, when for example an industry uses imported goods as intermediate inputs for its activity, this does not give rise to domestic but to foreign jobs. Is is only when domestically produced goods are used as intermediate inputs that jobs are generated and value available domestically is created, indirectly, through the interlocking dependencies between industrial sectors.

Figure \ref{IOT_importsUses} represents an IOT that integrates this information. Each of the uses \{$z_{ij}$, $c_i$, $g_i$, $e_i$, $i_i$,  $inv_i$\} is now split up in a domestic and an imported part, indicated with respective superfixes $^d$ and $^m$. For example, the industries' intermediate inputs $z_{ij}$ of table \ref{IOT_basic} ar split in two parts $z_{ij}^d$ and $z_{ij}^m$. The same equivalent relationship holds for all the other uses. We thus get : 
\begin{align}
z_{ij} &= z_{ij}^d + z_{ij}^m. \label{usesDecompMX} \\
c_i &= c_i^d + c_i^m \nonumber \\
&\ldots \nonumber
\end{align}  Note that the relationship is also assumed for exports $e_i$. Indeed, some of imported goods are re-exported. 	

On the basis of an IOT table, a model can be built making one specific assumption. This assumption is inspired by interpreting the first $n$ elements in the columns of each industry as a production technology or a production function. Specifically, it is assumed that the amount of inputs per unit of output is constant. Additionally, we will also assume the share of value added in output, and the labour, capital and tax share in value added to be constant and the same as in the reference IOT.

\subsection{Input-output demand-pull model}

A much used application of the IOT is the demand-pull model. The demand-pull model allows to calculate for a given scenario of final demand, how much output each of the sectors needs to provide, and how much goods need to be imported, to satisfy that demand. %The model calculates the total production requirements to satisfy demand. 
The total output needed is made up of the sum of the products used in different stages in the production process. The first component of output is of course final demand itself. To that, one has to add the inputs needed to produce these final goods and services. These inputs are called the direct requirements. In addition, for the production of these inputs, an additional set of inputs are needed, the production of which requires in their turn again more inputs, etc. The sum of all these latter input requirements are called the indirect requirements.

In the context of this paper, the comparison of different export scenarios, corresponding to BAU and 2Dg assumptions, will translate into different sets of total output requirements to the $n$ industrial sectors. These different projected production levels, or revenue streams, for each of the sectors translates into different levels of employment, taxes collected and capital income. The latter will affect the valuation of individual companies that make up the most impacted industries. 

In addition, because the model constructed here is based on the IOT in figure \ref{IOT_importsUses} that specifies the use of imports, what share of revenue stemming from the sale of final products is spent on imports.

The crucial assumption that is made when constructing and applying the demand-pull IO-model is that the inputs needed to produce one unit of output are the same at all stages of the production process, where with stages is meant the production of the final products, the direct and the indirect requirements.

%Denoting %$a_{ij}=z_{ij}/y_i$ the amount of inputs from sector $j$, sector $i$ uses to produce 1 unit of output, 
%$a_{ij}^d=z_{ij}^d/x_i$ the amount of domestically produced inputs of good $j$ used by sector $i$ to produce one unit of output, %and $a_{ij}^m=z_{ij}^m/x_i$ the amount of imported inputs of good $j$ used per unit of output from sector $i$, we get :


Thus, the demand-pull model is based on the central tenet that for each sector $j$, the ratio of each type of input $z_{ij}^k$, $i$ $\in$ \{1,\ldots, n\}, $k$ $\in$ \{d, m\} to the sector's output $x_j$ is constant. This is to be thought of as a recipe : if making a loaf of bread demands $400g$ of flour, then to make two breads one needs $800g$ of flour. We will denote these ratios $a_{ij}^k$. They represent the output needed of a certain type to make one unit of output : 
\begin{equation}
a_{ij}^k = z_{ij}^k/x_j. \label{sharesIntermediate}
\end{equation}
Secondly, we make the hypothesis of constant shares of domestically produced final goods for each type of final demand to the %, consumption, government expenditure, exports, capital formation, of each type of good $i$, to the 
total (imported plus domestically produced) final demand of that type, is constant. For example for consumption, we suppose the constant share $s^d_{ci}$ (eqn. \ref{sharesFinal}). Similar hypothesis are made for government expenditure, exports and capital formation of all the $n$ types of goods.
\begin{align}
s^d_{ci}&=c_i^d/c_i, \ \ \  i=1:n \label{sharesFinal}\\
s^d_{gi}&=g_i^d/g_i, \ \ \  i=1:n \nonumber\\
&\ldots \nonumber
\end{align} 

The combination of the hypothesis embodied in equations \ref{sharesIntermediate} and \ref{sharesFinal} and the accounting equations embodied in the rows of the IOT (figure \ref{IOT_importsUses}) yield the model. The accounting equations hold that (a) for every sector $i$ ($i \in \{1,\ldots,n\}$), its total output $x_i$ is given by the sum of total intermediate inputs plus final demand minus imports of that good, (b) resources stemming from importation are used for final and intermediate consumption and (c) the same holds for domestic production. Using eqns.\ref{usesDecompMX} and \ref{sharesIntermediate}, we get : %: $x_i = \sum_j z_{ij} + c_i + g_i + i_i + inv_i + e_i - m_i$, where $z_{ij}$ stands for the intermediate inputs used by sector $j$ and provided by sector $i$, $c_i$ and $g_i$ stand for consumption by household and government, $i_i$ is investment, $e_i$ exports and $m_i$ is imports. This equation can be rewritten as equation \ref{IOT} to show, on the left-hand side, how the total amount of goods available to be used by the domestic economy is obtained, and on the right-hand side how the goods are used :  
\begin{align}
x_i + m_i &= \sum_j a_{ij} \, x_j + c_i + g_i + i_i + inv_i + e_i \label{useAll} \\
m_i &= \sum_j a_{ij}^m \, x_j+ c_i^m + g_i^m + i_i^m + inv_i^m + e_i^m \label{useImports} \\
x_i &= \sum_j a_{ij}^d \, x_j + c_i^d + g_i^d + i_i^d + inv_i^d + e_i^d \label{useOutput} 
%x_i + m_i &= \sum_j (z_{ij}^d + z_{ij}^m) + c^d_i + g_i^d + i_i^d + inv_i^d + e_i^d +  c_i^m + g_i^m + i_i^m + inv_i^m + e_i^m \label{allUSes}
\end{align}

%The goods obtained through domestic production and imports are consumed domestically, for intermediary ($z_{ij}$) or final  purposes ($c_i$, $g_i$, $i_i$, $inv_i$) and the remaining share is exported and a source of revenue. However, the equation does not provide information on what share of consumption by households of good $i$ stems from domestic production $c_i^d$ versus from imports $c_i^m = c_i - c_i^d$. The same is true for the other uses $u_i$, $u_i \in \{z_{ij}, c_i, g_i, i_i, inv_i, e_i\}$ on the right-hand side of eqn. \ref{useAll}.

%(We suppose that the imported goods are not exported. This assumption is not neutral and thus not necessarily hold for all sectors, given the aggregation level of the SA IO table. For example, for the sector Motor vehicles ($I32$), a substantial share, $32\%$ of the value of the sector's inputs are from within the same sector. Additionally, $25\%$ of total output is exported and $76\%$ of total input is imported (+ imports are larger than total intermediate inputs). This suggests that there is both imports of finished vehicles, since import is larger than intermediate use in this category. Additionally, given the high value of imports, it suggests that there is import of parts which get assembled in SA.)

%To take into account that the demand for imported goods does not directly create value or give rise to jobs domestically (although the imported goods might be necessary for a particular production process), separate IOTs for domestic output and imported goods and services are needed\footnote{The OECD provides such tables at a level of detail of 35 sectors, the most recent one for the year 2011. The South African statistical agency provides a table with a level of detail of 50 sectors, the most recent for the year 2014, but that does not distinguish the use of imports.}. Each of these specifies accounting equations \ref{useOutput} and \ref{useImports} that permit to decompose eqn. \ref{IOT} in eqn. \ref{allUSes}:

We can now use the two sets of equations \ref{useOutput} and \ref{useImports} to calculate, for a given final demand scenario $y_i= c_i + g_i + i_i + inv_i + e_i$, the output required of all sectors and importation of all types of goods, assuming the $a_{ij}^k$, $i$ $\in$ \{1,\ldots, n\}, $k$ $\in$ \{d, m\} are known.
%To study the impact of changes in export or domestic price changes of specific goods and services on the domestic economy, only the set of equations \ref{useOutput} is needed.
The set of equations \ref{useOutput} yield domestic production which in turn allows the calculation of imports with the equations \ref{useImports}. 

For easier notation, we write these two sets of equations in matrix format. Output, imports and the five types of final demand for the $n$ types of goods are each grouped in $n \times 1$ column vectors, which are denoted in bold small letters. Capital letters indicate $n \times n$ matrices. The total, domestic and imports direct requirements matrices, $A$, $A^d$ and $A^m$, have as elements on row $i$ and column $j$ the technical coefficients $a_{ij}$, $a^d_{ij}$ and $a^m_{ij}$. Five matrices are introduced that contain the shares of domestic/imported final demand in total final demand (given by equation \ref{sharesFinal}) on the diagonal and zero's elsewhere  : $S^k_{c}$, $S^k_{g}$, $S^k_{e}$, $S^k_{i}$ and $S^k_{inv}$, $k$ $\in$ \{d, m\}. Of course, $S^d_{c} + S^m_{c} = \mathbb{I}$, where $\mathbb{I}$ is the $n \times n$ unitary matrix.

\begin{align}
\boldsymbol{x} &= A^d\,  \boldsymbol{x} + S^d_{c} \, \boldsymbol{c} + S^d_{g} \, \boldsymbol{g} + S^d_{i} \, \boldsymbol{i} + S^d_{inv} \, \boldsymbol{inv} + S^d_{e}\,  \boldsymbol{e} \label{useOutputsDom} \\
\boldsymbol{m} &= A^m \, \boldsymbol{x} + S^m_{c} \,\boldsymbol{c} + S^m_{g}\, \boldsymbol{g} + S^m_{i}\, \boldsymbol{i} + S^m_{inv}\, \boldsymbol{inv} + S^m_{e}\, \boldsymbol{e} \label{useOutputsImport} 
\end{align}

Rearranging equation \ref{useOutputsDom}, we get :
\begin{align}
\boldsymbol{y}^d &= S^d_{c} \, \boldsymbol{c} + S^d_{g} \, \boldsymbol{g} + S^d_{i} \, \boldsymbol{i} + S^d_{inv} \, \boldsymbol{inv} + S^d_{e} \, \boldsymbol{e} \nonumber \\
\boldsymbol{y}^m &= S^m_{c} \, \boldsymbol{c} + S^m_{g} \, \boldsymbol{g} + S^m_{i} \, \boldsymbol{i} + S^m_{inv} \, \boldsymbol{inv} + S^m_{e} \, \boldsymbol{e} \nonumber  \\
\boldsymbol{x} &= \big(\mathbb{I} - A^d \big)^{-1} \, \boldsymbol{y}^d \label{outputVector} \\
\boldsymbol{m} &= A^m \, \boldsymbol{x} + \boldsymbol{y}^m \label{importVector} 
%\boldsymbol{m} &= A^m  \boldsymbol{x} + \boldsymbol{c}^m + \boldsymbol{g}^m + \boldsymbol{i}^m + \boldsymbol{inv}^m + \boldsymbol{e}^m \label{useOutputsImport} 
\end{align}
Matrix $\big(\mathbb{I} - A^d \big)^{-1}$ is the domestic Leontief inverse which we note $B^d$. The elements $x_i$ of $\boldsymbol{x}$ are equal to a sum of $n$ terms : $x_i = \sum_j b_{ij}y_j$. Each of these terms are interpreted as follows : $b_{ij}y_j$ represents the output of sector $i$ stemming from the final demand addressed to sector $j$. The total $x_i$ is the total output needed from sector $i$ to satisfy the demand scenario $\boldsymbol{y}$. Because we are interested in each of these terms, the diagonal matrices $C$, $G$, $E$, $I$, $INV$ and $Y$ are introduced with the elements of the respective vectors (denoted by the same letter in lower case and bold) on the diagonal and zeros off-diagonal. Then, eqn. \ref{outputVector} becomes $X = \big(\mathbb{I} - A^d \big)^{-1} \, Y^d$, where $X$ has elements $x_{ij} = b_{ij}y_{jj}$. The interpretation of these elements is the same as for $b_{ij}y_j$ given above, since $y_j = y_{jj}$.

Similarly, we are interested in the terms that make up the vector $\boldsymbol{m}$ as given by eqn. \ref{importVector} or of the matrix $M$ given by $M = A^m \, X + Y^m$. Element $m_{ik}$ of $M$ is given by $m_{ik} = \sum_j a_{ij}x_{jk}$ which represents the the import of good $i$ by all sectors in response to demand of sector $k$. Element $m_i$ of $\boldsymbol{m}$ is then the import of good $i$ in response to demand from all sectors. However, for our analysis, we would like to know the import of all $n$ types of goods, done by each sector, in response to demand from sector $k$. Thus, we would like to know the sum $\sum_i a_{ij}x_{jk}$, which is the import expense of sector $j$ in response to demand from sector $k$. 

To this end we introduce the matrices $X^k$, which are diagonal matrices with the $k$th column of $X$ on the diagonal and zero elsewhere. The demand-pull IO-model, which allows to calculate the output and import by all the sectors needed to satisfy given final demand $\boldsymbol{y}$ (and if relevant its components, eg. consumption,\ldots), then becomes :
\begin{align}
Y^d &= S^d_{c} \, C + S^d_{g} \, G + S^d_{i} \, I + S^d_{inv} \, INV + S^d_{e} \, E \\
Y^m &= S^m_{c} \,C + S^m_{g}\, G + S^m_{i}\, I + S^m_{inv}\, INV + S^m_{e}\, E \\
X &= \big(\mathbb{I} - A^d \big)^{-1} \, Y^d  \\
M^k &= A^m \, X^k + Y^m, \ \ \  k \in \{1,\ldots,n\}
%\boldsymbol{m} &= A^m  \boldsymbol{x} + \boldsymbol{c}^m + \boldsymbol{g}^m + \boldsymbol{i}^m + \boldsymbol{inv}^m + \boldsymbol{e}^m \label{useOutputsImport} 
\end{align}
In summary, the above model allows to calculate the output of all sectors and import by all sectors needed to satisfy a given final demand scenario. The matrices with parameters of the model are the direct requirement matrices $A^d$ and $A^m$, and the share matrices $S^d_{c}$, $S^d_{g}$, $S^d_{e}$, $S^d_{i}$ and $S^d_{inv}$. Final demand for domestic production is given by $Y^d$ which is zero off-diagonal ; its $i$th diagonal element is final demand for domestically produced goods addressed to sector $i$. Final demand for imported goods is given by $Y^m$, of which the $i$th diagonal element represents the final demand for imported goods of sector $i$ ; again, the off-diagonal elements are zero. The results of the model are to be found in the output matrix $X$ and the $n$ import matrices $M$. The elements $x_{ij}$ of $X$ give the output sector $j$ needs from sector $i$ to satisfy the final demand scenario. The elements $m^k_{ij}$ of $M^k$ represent the import of good $i$ done by sector $j$ to satisfy demand (in domestically produced goods) from sector $k$. Thus, the columns sums of $M^k$ are the imported goods, intermediate and final, of all types sector $j$ needs to satisfy demand from sector $k$.


%In the absence of seperate IOTs for domestic production and imports, the fast solution is to suppose that for every type of use $u_i$, the share $s_{i}^d$ of domestic output within the total use is equal over all the types of uses made :
%\begin{align}
%s_i^d &= \frac{y_i}{y_i + m_i} \\
%u_i^d &= s_i^d \, u_i \label{shareM} \\
%u_i^m &= (1-s_i^d) \, u_i
%\end{align}
%where $u_i^d$ and $u_i^m$ stand for all the possible uses made of respectively domestic output and imported products : $u_i^m \in \{z_{ij}^m, c_i^m, g_i^m, i_i^m, inv_i^m, x_i^m\}$ and $u_i^d \in \{z_{ij}^d, c_i^d, g_i^d, i_i^d, inv_i^d, x_i^d\}$.

%Going to back to matrix notation and denoting $S^d$ the diagonal matrix of the shares $s_i^d$ and 0's off-diagonal, then :
%\begin{align}
%A^d &= S^d \, A \\
%C^d &= S^d \, C \\
%G^d &= S^d \, G \\
%I^d &= S^d \, I \\
%INV^d &= S^d \, INV \\
%E^d &= S^d \, E 
%\end{align}

%Combining the above with eqn. \ref{useOutputsDom} and denoting $\mathbb{I}$ the identity matrix, we obtain the demand-driven input-output model that allows to determine for a given scenario of final demand $D = (C, G, I, INV, X )$, the output per sector needed :
%\begin{equation}
%%Y  = S^d \, A \, Y + S^d \, (C + G + I + INV + X)  \label{IO1} \\
%X = (\mathbb{I} - S^d \, A)^{-1} \,  S^d \, (C + G + I + INV + E)  \label{IOdemand-driven}
%\end{equation}

\subsection{Decomposition revenue from final demand}



The revenue coming into the country from selling goods to other countries is distributed, following the logic of economic activity, to different participants. Part of the export revenue pays workers, part goes to the state via taxes, and the remaining part represents the remuneration of capital, which is in practice the money used to pay back debt, pay shareholders, etc. However, not all the revenue coming into the country via exports of say sector $i$ stays within the country. Part is used to import intermediate goods used in the production of the exported goods and thus leaves the country again. The part of the export revenue that is used by sector $i$ to buy intermediate goods for its production (of exported goods) is a cost to the sector but not a loss for the domestic economy : the cost to sector $i$ is revenue for supplying sectors, who after paying in turn their supplying sector, use the remainder, value added, to pay wages, taxes and remunerate capital. This suggests that the export revenue can be traced back into a part leaving the country, and a part distributed as value added --- wages, taxes and capital remuneration --- throughout the economy. 

First we show that the revenue coming in via final demand, in our case we are most interested in exports, can be decomposed entirely in value added created in the different sector of the economy. (To simplify, we assume away for now "Taxes on production (?)".)

\ldots

We thus see that the total value of final demand has spread throughout the economy creating value in different sectors. The matrix ... traces back that value to where the demand for the products generated. However, not all the value originates in the domestic economy. 

The cost of imported inputs represent export revenue for the rest of the world (RoW) and thus represent foreign value added, which is embedded in gross exports, part of final demand y. 

There are two separate issues : one is that the demand for imported intermediate goods does not generate jobs within the economy, the second is how the demand generated for domestic goods, whether it be final or the indirectly generated demand for intermediates, canbe decomposed as value added over the whole economy. 


\subsection{Employment content}

The employment content $ec_i$ of sector $i$, defined as the number of direct and indirect jobs created through one unit of output of sector $i$. To calculate the employment content of all sectors, define the $n \times n$ matrix $EC$ where $ec_{ij}$  is the number of jobs of sector $j$ created because of demand to sector $i$. Direct employment in sector $j$ is then defined as $ec_{jj}$ and indirect employment as $\sum_{i, i\neq j} ec_{ij}$. The total employment content $ec_j$ of sector $j$ is given by $\sum_i ec_{ij}$. The employment content matrix $EC$ is calculated using the diagonal matrix $E$ where $e_{ii}$ is the amount of employees of sector $i$ per unit of its output, and in addition the domestic leontief inverse matrix $LI^d$. The elements $li_{ij}^d$ of the leontief inverse $LI^d$ say how much sector $i$ needs to produce such that sector $j$ can produce one unit of final domestic demand. (Assuming that a share of intermediate and final uses is supplied through imports.)

\begin{align}
%	Y	 &= LI^d \, (I - S)\, (C + G + I + INV + X) \\
	ECT	 &= E\, LI^d \, (\mathbb{I} - S^m)\, (C + G + I + INV + X) \label{IO3} \\ 
	LI^d &= (\mathbb{I} - (\mathbb{I}-S^m)\, A)^{-1} \label{leontiefInverse_d}
\end{align}

The employment content is then defined as the number of jobs created through a single unit of final demand, thus by setting $C + G + I + INV + X=\mathbb{I}$, where $\mathbb{I}$ is the identity matrix. 
\begin{equation}
	EC	= E\, LI^d \, S^d \label{EC} \\ 
\end{equation}
where $S^d = \mathbb{I} - S^m$ contains the shares of domestic output in total supply of goods, i.e. supply through imports and through domestic production, available for domestic use and for exports. In the above equation, $E$ and $S^d$ are diagonal matrices with 0's off-diagonal.


The above equation allows us to calculate the employment content of each of the sectors. Next, following QQ, EC is decomposed to understand what generates the differences in employment content between sectors. 

Employment per unit of output is decomposed as :
\begin{align}
	E &= \frac{\mli{VA^d}}{Y} \, \frac{\mli{VA}^{HT}}{\mli{VA}^d} \, \frac{\mli{COMP}}{\mli{VA^{HT}}} \, \frac{\mli{NPE}}{\mli{COMP}}   \label{decompE} \\ 
	&= \frac{\mli{VA^d}}{Y} \, T \, L \, N \\
	T &= \\
	L &= \\
	N &= 
\end{align}
where $\mli{VA^d}$ is, $\mli{VA}^{HT}$, $\mli{COMP}$,$T$, $L$, $N$ and are all diagonal matrices with 0's off-diagonal.

The domestic leontief inverse is decomposed into the total leontief inverse and factors that reflect the import rates of intermediate inputs : 
\begin{equation}
	LI^d = \mli{LI} \odot \mli{MI} \label{decompLId}
\end{equation}
where $\odot$ designates the element wise Hadamard multiplication of matrices.

Combining \ref{EC}, \ref{decompE} and \ref{decompLId}, brings us close to the final decomposition that will be used :

\begin{equation}
EC	= \frac{\mli{VA}^d}{Y} \, T \, L \, N \, \mli{LI} \odot \mli{MI} \, S^d,   \label{decompEC1} \\ 
\end{equation}
Again, note that the matrices with possibly non-zero elements off-diagonal are $EC$, $LI$ and $MI$. Next QQ sets :

$$ V = \frac{\mli{VA}^d}{Y} \mli{LI}$$ 

such that :
\begin{equation}
EC	= T \, L \, N \, V \odot \mli{MI} \, S^d,   \label{decompEC1} \\ 
\end{equation}
which can equivalently be written as :

\begin{equation}
EC	= \bar{T} \odot \bar{L} \odot \bar{N} \odot V \odot \mli{MI} \odot \bar{\bar{S^d}},   \label{decompEC2} \\ 
\end{equation}

where the operation denoted by the single bar $\bar{\ }$ is right multiplication with $\mathbb{J}$ the $n\times n$ matrix with all ones, $\bar{T} = T \, \mathbb{J}$, and the operation denoted by the double bar $\bar{\bar{\ }}$ is left multiplication with $\mathbb{J}$, $\bar{\bar{S^d}} = \mathbb{J} \, S^d$. 

\subsection{Cost-push model}

The input-output table can also be used to determine, when the price of an input $i$ changes with respect to a base scenario, what the impact would be on the prices of all the other sectors, assuming that the increased cost is fully transferred to buyers. This implies that the profitability of each sector is not impacted and that they still use the same quantities of all inputs. 

Given a reference IOT measured in value, then for the base scenario, prices $p_i$ for all sectors $i$ can be fixed at 1, such that that the IOT in quantities has the same numerical values as the one in value. For the base scenario, the vector of all prices is written as $\boldsymbol{p}$ (and is thus a vector of all 1's).

If $Z$ is the inter-industry matrix (in quantity) of size $n\times n$ with all sectors, then we denote $Z^{-i}$ the inter-industry matrix of size $n-1 \times n-1$ where the row of inputs from sector $i$ to other sectors and the columns of uses of $i$ are omitted. Denoting the $1 \times n-1$ row of inputs of sector $i$ to other sectors except for to itself as $(inp^{-i}_i)^T$, the accounting equations that follow from the first $n$ columns of the IOT then read :

\begin{equation}
(p^{-i})^T \, Y^{-i} = (p^{-i})^T Z^{-i} + (inp^{-i}_i)^T + (gva^{-i})^T + (t^{-i})^T \label{cost-push1}
%(y^{-i})^T =  Z^{-i} + (inp^{-i}_i)^T + (gva^{-i})^T + (t^{-i})^T
\end{equation}

where $Y^{-1}$ is the diagonal $n-1 \times n-1$ matrix of output, measured in quantities, and $(p^{-1})^T$, $(gva^{-1})^T$  and $(t^{-1})^T$ are the $1 \times n-1$ row-vectors of respectively prices, gross value added a net taxes on products. Right-multiplying equation \ref{cost-push1} with the diagonal matrix with the inverse of total output measured in quantities on the diagonal and 0's elsewhere, $\underline{Y}^{-i}$,we get :
\begin{equation}
(p^{-i})^T  = (p^{-i})^T A^{-i} + \Big((inp^{-i}_i)^T + (gva^{-i})^T + (t^{-i})^T \Big)\, \underline{Y}^{-i} \label{cost-push2}
\end{equation}
and equivalently :
\begin{equation}
(p^{-i})^T  =  \Big((inp^{-i}_i)^T + (gva^{-i})^T + (t^{-i})^T \Big)\, \underline{Y}^{-i} \, (I - A^{-i})^{-1} \label{cost-push3}
\end{equation}
where the vector $p^{-i}$ contains all 1's.

Consider an alternative scenario $A$ where the price of input $i$ changes by $\lambda\%$ for all sectors with respect to the base scenario, then the value of inputs $inp^{A^{-i}}_{i} = (1+\lambda/100)\, inp^{-i}_i$. The resulting prices in all the other sectors are given by :
\begin{equation}
(p^{A^{-i}})^T  =  \Big((inp^{A^{-i}}_i)^T + (gva^{-i})^T + (t^{-i})^T \Big)\, \underline{Y}^{-i} \, (I - A^{-i})^{-1} \label{cost-push-scen}
\end{equation}

This price increase can be interpreted as a measure for how the total cost of the price change is distributed over all sectors. In addition, the cost to final consumers can be determined. 





\section{Data}

The data used for the present study are obtained from Statistics South Africa (Stat SA), the South African national statistical agency, and from the OECD. The latter are in itself based on the data collected by Stat SA. The latter offer additional information because of the treatments data underwent (aggregation, seasonal adjustment). %and because the data for South Africa have been put in relation to data  are however useful in some instances because they offer access to different types of pre-treatments . 

\subsection{Datasources}

\subsubsection{IOT}	

The most recent input output tables available from Stat SA are for the years 2013 and 2014. The level of detail is at 50 sectors. However, no table is available that specifies uses of imports versus uses of domestic production. Such a table is provided by the OECD, at a detail of 35 sectors ; the most recent one is for 2011 at the time of writing.

To take into account that the demand for imported goods does not directly create value or give rise to jobs domestically (although the imported goods might be necessary for a particular production process), separate IOTs for domestic output and imported goods and services are needed\footnote{The OECD provides such tables at a level of detail of 35 sectors, the most recent one for the year 2011. The South African statistical agency provides a table with a level of detail of 50 sectors, the most recent for the year 2014, but that does not distinguish the use of imports.}. 

\subsubsection{Employment data}
For the present study employment data are needed of the same sectoral aggregation as the 50-sector IOT. These are not readily available but are constructed on the basis of two types of employment data and in addition more detailed data for certain sectors, all collected by and available from Stat SA.
 
Data on employment are gathered by the South African statistics agency through two types of channels. The Quarterly Employment Survey is conducted with enterprises \citep{QES2018}. The Quarterly Labour Force Survey is a survey taken from households from individuals aged 15 years and over. Contrary to the former, the data thus obtained cover also the agricultural sector, self-employed workers whose businesses are unincorporated, unpaid family workers, and private household workers among the employed \citep{QLFS2018}.

The QES offers employment numbers for the all sectors, excluding agriculture and private households, at a level of detail of 91 sectors. The QLFS offers data at a disaggregation of the economy of 10 sectors. Thus, while the QLFS covers more types of workers, the QES is more detailed.

The IOT, although on average less detailed than the employment data sourced from the QES, offers for a few sectors a different or more detailed disaggregation than the 91 sectors used by the former. This is the case for "Agriculture" (SIC 1), the "Mining and quarrying" sector (SIC 2), and for "Coke oven products; petroleum refineries; processing of nuclear fuel" (SIC 33). To obtain estimates compatible with the IOT, assumptions and additional data are used. Also, to obtain final numbers, the choice is made to include all types of workers, self-employed workers whose businesses are unincorporated, unpaid family workers, and private household workers. %i.e. to suppose total employment as given by the QLFS.
 
The last assumption implies that the final data set results in the same numbers when aggregated to the 10 sectors of QLFS. Thus, to obtain data for agriculture, the QLFS estimate is used, disaggregated to Agriculture (SIC 11), Forestry (SIC 12), Fishing (SIC 13) according to their shares in output for the year 2014. 

The employment data for the mining sector are disaggregated into gold and non-gold in the QES. To get numbers for the same disaggregation as the IOT table (SIC 21 coal, 23-24 gold and metals, 25 other), data are used from the 2015 report from Stat SA on the Mining industry \citep{mining2015}. In the report, both direct employees of the mining industry are included, as employees through labour brokers, of subcontractors and capital employees\lies{what are those?}, for xx subsectors of the mining industry. %The total thus obtained in the report is 490146, versus 459271 in the quarterly employment series 2009-2018. Also, the proportion working for the gold mines SIC 23 is different. In the quarterly series, 21\% of people in the mining sector work for gold, versus 25\% according to the survey.
To obtain an estimate for the number of people working in SIC 21, 23+24 and 25, the non-gold share of the quarterly series is disaggregated according to the shares of the mining report. 

To obtain the disaggregation of sector 33 as in the IOT, it is assumed that shares of workers employed in each subsector are equal to the shares of output.

Finally, after the QES data are aggregated into 50 sectors, volume adjustments are made based on the QLFS numbers.

Employment data are also available from the OECD at a level of 7 sectors. These allow to make a final check of the obtained data (figure \ref{ComparisonOECD-STATSA-Empldata_2014}). The main difference found is between sectors ISIC rev.3 G-I and L-P. G-I covers Wholesale and Retail trade and L-P service activities among which Private Households.

\subsection{Uses and resources}

Figures \ref{Uses_Resources_percent_2014} and \ref{Uses_Resources_abs_2014} give a visual summary of the input-output table. For each of the 50 sectors of the IOT, they provide an overview of how goods are obtained --- imported versus domestically produced --- displayed in the right-hand columns and how they are used in the left-hand column. How imports and production are used is divided up between intermediate consumption, final uses such as consumption (by households and government) and building of the capital stock (accumulation of the fixed stock and inventories) and for export. Left- and right-hand columns necessarily have the same height because of equation \ref{IOT}. Figure \ref{Uses_Resources_percent_2014} shows per sector the share, dissimulating the information on the relative size of the different sectors. Figure \ref{Uses_Resources_abs_2014} retains this last information ; however, due to the large size of some service sectors, the distribution of uses and resources is somewhat lost for many.  

Figure \ref{Uses_Resources_abs_2014} shows from what sectors South Africa obtained export revenue in 2014 (the year for which the most recent IOT is available). These are in order of magnitude : Metal ores (SIC 23-24), Transport (SIC 71-74), Trade (SIC 61-63), Basic iron and steel (SIC 351 \& 353), Coal and lignite (SIC 21), Other services nec, Other mining (SIC 25), Motor vehicles (381-387). Three of these are services (Transport, Trade and Other services nec). %The non-service output in this list is made up of Metal ores, Basic iron and steel (SIC 351 \& 353), Coal and lignite (SIC 21) and Motor vehicles. 
As pointed out by the CPI, the export goods for which global demand is (very) likely or possibly different between a BAU and a 2DS scenario are some metal ores such as ... and coal. Export of metal ores provides about xx \% of GDP and of coal about $1\%$\li{small tables}.

Judging from the dark blue rectangles of the right-hand columns of figure \ref{Uses_Resources_abs_2014}, the most imported goods are mostly manufactured products, with at the third place Other mining, which includes crude oil. For crude oil the price on the international market is expected to be lower in a 2DS versus BAU. 

Transport costs higher ? Impact on place in GVC ? OECD : between 15-20 of export is imported (check).

%\subsubsection{Employment}

\subsection{Decomposition employment content}
Figures \ref{Decomposition_direct_indirect_avg} and \ref{Decomposition_direct_indirect_absolute} shows the total employment content --- the number of persons employed to generate 1 million rand of final output --- for each of the 50 sectors of the IOT, decomposed into jobs that are directly generated within the concerned sector ("Direct" in red), and jobs that are situated in other sectors, due to demand stemming from the concerned sector for intermediate products ("Indirect" in blue).

In figures \ref{Decomposition_PQ} and \ref{Decomposition_direct_indirect_avg}, the difference between the employment content (EC) for each sector and the average employment content over the economy is visualized. In figure \ref{Decomposition_direct_indirect_avg},  the EC is decomposed into its direct and indirect components, and how those relate to the average number of jobs directly and indirectly generated. In figure \ref{Decomposition_PQ}, total employment content is decomposed according to eqn. \ref{}, specifying whether high/low employment in a particular sector is mainly due to low/high wages, high/low domestic demand, etc.

Overall, it can be seen that when the employment content of a sector is high, it is generally mainly due to low wages in the given sector. 

The employment content in the mining sector is lower than average, because of a low labour share and higher wages than the economy's average. The factor "local final demand" contributes above average ; this is due to low import and high export. Figure \ref{Decomposition_direct_indirect_absolute} shows that about half the jobs created by final demand for coal, gold etc. is created indirectly, by the production of intermediate inputs needed for mining. This means that for every job created or destroyed in the mining sector because of changes in final demand, another job is created or destroyed throughout the economy, in other sectors.

%The mining industry generates less jobs per unit of final output than the economy's average. Both the mining of coal and lignite and of metal ores generate as many jobs through directly as indirectly per unit of final demand. The number of indirect jobs created is close to the average. It is the amount of directly generated jobs that is well below the average. Figure \ref{ECdecomposition-avg-PQ_2014.pdf} shows the reasons behind the lower-than average employment content. A low labour share and high wages are the main reason ; there is a positive contribution from	the factor designated by "local final demand" which contributes positively to the labour share when imports are small or when exports are large. Both are the case for the two mining sectors. In Other mining (25), which includes the import of crude oil, there is a similar contribution to a low employment content from a low labour share and higher-than-average wages ; additionally, due to the large share of imports in this sector, the employment content sinks even further below the economy's average.

\subsection{Key sectors}
The difference in direct and indirect effects generated by the 2DS versus the BAU scenarios will be estimated with the the aid of the most recent input-output table (2014). Throughout the analysis, it will be assumed that the inter-dependencies between the different sectors in the economy --- the value of input bought by sector $i$ from $j$ to produce 1 mR of output by $i$ --- are assumed to be as in the year 2014. %In a few (1 ?) cases,  

In reality, this assumption does not hold. The 2014 IOT used is measured in value and its numbers might change both because of changes in the relative price of commodities and because over time sector's systems of production change, as reflected in and defined by the amount of inputs used per unit of output. For example, the cost of coal use for 1 $kWh$ of electricity can change on the one hand because the domestic price of coal changes, without changing the $kg$s used, or because solar panels replace coal.

The scenario comparisons in section \ref{scenarioAnalysis} cover the period 2018-2035, over which both relative prices and systems of production will have changed, both under BAU as under 2DS assumptions. This study will not attempt to estimate how the IOT might change over the modeling period ; the assumption is that the 2014 IOT is a good approximation. In order to get picture of the information the 2014 IOT provides, the following subsections describe key sectors for transition scenarios, their place within the economy and how they are linked to other sectors. This will give a first idea of the dominant risks, via indirect effects, of the external transition scenarios. Information on the two types of transmission channels is set forth : how changes in one sector impact others because they use the former's commodity as input and secondly because it uses inputs from others. 


\subsubsection{Coal}
At the beginning of the period 2010-2017, the mining sector (SIC 2) represents about 8\% of GDP, contributing about half a percentage point less to GDP towards the end of the period \citep{P0441StatSA2018Q2} (measured in constant 2010 prices). 

Within the mining sector, coal mining (SIC 21, Coal and lignite) contributed 24.4\% in 2012 and 28.1\% in 2015 to the sector's total income \citep{mining2015}. The primary source of income of the coal mining industry is exports, which represent 55.5\% of production. Most of the remaining share is sold to industries who use coal as inputs (41.3\%), notably for electricity production. Products of the coal mining industry are almost basically obtained through domestic production, only 0.4\% of the coal used in the economy is imported (table \ref{Mining2104_UR} and figure \ref{Uses_Resources_percent_2014}).

\begin{table}[!h]

		& Uses & Resources  \\

	\caption{\label{Mining2104_UR}Sector \emph{Coal and lignite}, SIC 21.

The left hand column, Uses, shows how the sector's commodity is used domestically and how much is exported. The data are for the year 2014. Source, \cite{IOT2014}.}
\end{table} 

Hence, the export of coal directly contributed in 2014 about 1.2\% to GDP, with similar shares for more recent years (which are ?). This implies that movements in coal exports impact GDP significantly. 

Furthermore, CPI analysis hypothesizes that the domestic price of coal might increase due to the loss of cross-subsidies from exports. This price increase represents a cost that can spread throughout the whole economy if the increase in the domestic coal-price is transferred to the price of electricity. Indeed, coal inputs represent a cost of roughly 0,9\% of GDP to the South African economy in the form of intermediary inputs, of which more than half (57 \%) is used for electricity production. %Thus, movements in the domestic coal-price can get transferred to the whole economy via the electricity price.
Figure \ref{ElecPiechart} shows that all sectors, including households, spend rather similar shares of expenses on electricity.% in a rather evenly distributed manner. 
Electricity costs on average xx \% $\pm$ xx\% of output (of costs / ?). %Thus, in the case, as CPI analysis shows, the domestic price of coal increases due to the loss of cross-subsidies from exports, the 
A possible increase of the price of electricity will thus impact the entire industry. Households spend about 2.5\% of total expenditures on electricity\footnote{All mentioned figures are for the year 2014, obtained from the 2014 input-output table \citep{IOT2014}}. However, % depending on how the increase of the cost of electricity propagates throughout the economy --- either the profitability of industries is impacted and/or the cost increase is transferred in the price of commodities --- 
final consumers and notably households might bear more of the increased cost of coal if the cost is transferred to final consumption goods then what is suggested by their direct electricity consumption.

\input{../tables/SectorDescription/edited/4_Coal-and-lignite_IIusedBy.tex}

\input{../tables/SectorDescription/edited/33_Electricity,-gas-and-water_IIusedBy.tex}

The above describes how different coal export demand scenarios can have an effect on the economy as a whole because coal is used as an input, directly by some industries and indirectly by many through electricity use. The second channel through which different export scenarios impact the economy is due to the demand addressed to other sectors by the coal sector. Table \ref{} evaluates this effect in terms of the sector's employment content, defined as the number of jobs created --- throughout the economy --- by 1 million Rand of final demand addressed to the coal industry. For the coal sector, final demand is for 94.5\% made up of exports\footnote{Figure obtained from table \ref{Mining2104_UR}.}. 

%\input{../tables/Ind4_E_VA_2014.tex}
\input{../tables/Ind4_E_VA_2014_50Exp.tex}

The total employment content of the mining sector is lower than the economy's average, as can be seen in figure \ref{Decomposition_direct_indirect_avg}. This means that for 1 Rand of final demand addressed to the mining industry, less jobs are generated throughout the economy than when the same value of demand is distributed evenly over all sectors. On average in the economy, 2.48 jobs are created for 1 mR of final demand (local demand + exports) whereas in coal mining, 1.58 jobs are sustained throughout the economy. %by 1 mR of final demand addressed to the sector, by the sector's activity, of which. 
The direct employment content, which is the jobs generated within the coal sector, equals 0.72. The remaining share is the indirect employment content and equals 0.86. This is the number of jobs generated in other sectors by the export of coal. Table \ref{} shows that 68\% of these indirectly created jobs are situated in three sectors : Transport (33\%), Trade (23\%) and Computer activities (13\%). 

The Transport sector is thus, after coal mining itself, the first sector impacted by different coal export scenarios. 

% Look at what percentage of jobs comes from coal.

%The economic activity generated by the demand for final goods addressed to the coal mining sector, which is primarily export goods, generated by the sector's use of intermediate inputs, is situated in descending order in terms of the number of jobs created, in the Transport sector (SIC 74-71) with 0.27 jobs (per 1 mR final demand addressed to the mining sector), 0,19 to the Trade sector, 0,11 to Computer activities; 0,026 of Financial intermediation and 0,05 jobs divided equally over sectors 354-359, Structural metal and General Machinery.

\subsubsection{Electricity}

\end{figure}

Electricity is in South Africa provided by state-owned Eskom. In the first eight months of 2018, 91 \% of electricity was generated by Eskom \citep{P4141_201808}. The remaining share was generated by independent power producers (IPPs), which are mostly (all?) renewables. IPPs sell generated power to Eskom who is the sole transmitter and provides 60\% of distribution ; 40\% is distributed by municipalities.

In 2017, 85 \% of electricity was generated through coal-plants \citep{Eskom2017AR}. The remaining 15\% stems from the country's sole nuclear plant, gas-turbines, 4\% from renewables produced by IPPs and a small share is imported (figure \ref{Eskom2017PE}). Coal is historically the primary energy source of choice in South Africa, because easily mined domestically and thus cheap. Even though coal-prices have been rising, in 2018, the 85\% of coal-generated electricity represented 63 \% of the total primary energy cost for Eskom. Notably, the primary energy cost per $MWh$ of coal is 6-7 times lower than the price Eskom pays for electricity generated by IPPs \citep{Eskom2017AR}.

\end{figure}

Since 2008, real electricity prices have risen drastically in South Africa (figure \ref{Eskom-electricity-prices}). Part of the price increases are due to the rising cost of coal and part to the necessity to raise cash for investment in new capacity. The steady rise of the price is seen as a factor in the decline of electricity demand over the period 2011-2015 (figure \ref{Elecvolume_2010_2018}). Several studies have investigated the effect of the price hikes on demand, on an aggregate and on a sectoral level, for industry and for consumers, see \cite{goliger2018electricity} for an overview.

%It is against this backdrop that the additional source of increase in the generation cost of electricity under a 2DS --- the loss of cross-subsidies for the domestic coal-price because of reduced export --- has to be evaluated. 

It is against this backdrop that the possible higher domestic coal-price under 2DS has to evaluated. Indeed, the loss of cross-subsidies for coal consumed domestically due to lower export-volumes under 2DS constitute an additional source of increase in the generation cost of electricity under a 2DS versus a BAU scenario.

\paragraph{Household electricity demand}



\subsubsection{Platinum metal group}

The mining of metal ores generates 1.89 jobs throughout the economy per mR of final demand. 

\subsubsection{Oil}

The importation of crude oil falls under mining sector SIC 22, which is classified in the IOT under Other mining. The import figure of this sector corresponds to the import of crude oil. 

Refinement of crude oil falls under SIC 332, which is in the IOT grouped with 331 (coke oven products) 

\subsubsection{Global value chains}

Under a 2DS scenario, supply chains are necessarily "greener". 

How is South Africa's economy possibly exposed to the greening of global supply chains ? Is it risk for the economy ?
- the most obvious factor is the risk posed to coal exports
- what share of the SA economy is dependent on its inscription in global supply chains ? Are the economic activity and the jobs hence created under risk ? 
- the importance generally of global supply chains might be affected if transportation cost increases because of the necessity to reduce emissions
- companies might start to take into account the carbon content of supplies/intermediate inputs


\citep{von2016energy}


\section{Prospective analysis}

\subsection{Coal}

A clear external transition risk faced by the South African economy under a BAU versus a 2DS scenario, is the difference in global demand for coal between both. CPI's models estimate that the value of coal exports by South Africa over the period 2018-2035 under a 2DS is about half the value under BAU, with considerably lower export demand on the long term. Moreover, the price on the global market is expected to be lower under 2DS.

	\caption{\label{coalExport_BAUvs2DS_2035}Comparison of the impact of export demand on the number of jobs related to the activity in the coal mining sector (SIC 21). The percent difference in coal exports between the two scenarios is equal to that between BAU and 2DS in 2035 as projected by CPI. The BAU scenario is approximated by the South African economy as in the year 2014.}
\end{table}
%table

CPI's projections for coal export revenues towards 2035, i.e. towards the end of the period under study, are 90\% lower under 2DS than under BAU. The lower revenue is due both to lower export volumes and lower prices. Moreover, they project that the coal sector, thanks to sustained local demand mainly from electricity production, can support about 30 000 jobs on the long term.% towards the end of the period under consideration.

To make an estimate from a macroeconomic point of view of the effect on the economy of the difference in coal export revenue in 2035 under 2DS versus BAU, the demand-pull IO-model is used. % provided by eqn. \ref{IOdemand-driven}. %using the macroeconomic picture of the economy provided by the IO-model, of the effect on employment of the difference in coal export demand in 2035 under 2DS versus BAU, a comparison is made between the South African economy in the year 2014 and the same economy with the sole difference that coal exports are diminished by 90\%, following CPI's projections. 
%Both the direct and the indirect impacts in terms of revenue and jobs will be discussed. In a second instance the impact is traced to specific subsectors to evaluate what share of the activity of the concerned economic units is impacted.
The volume and the price change under both scenarios are treated in separate instances. The volume impact is taken into account by determining output and resulting employment per sector with the demand-pull model as in eqn. \ref{IOdemand-driven}, which assumes that prices are constant. Thus, the model is applied to the values of exports calculated as if the price is the BAU price, for both scenarios. Then, to take into account the price-effect, total revenue and gross operating surplus are recalculated assuming the actual price under 2DS. However, %the cost structure of the coal sector as provided by the 2014 IOT is left unchanged. This is not in accordance with the fact that 
the prospective price and volume scenarios of coal export under a 2DS provided by CPI, and used here as input, already include the impact on the profitability of the sector of the lower coal-price on the international market. A number of unprofitable mines are assumed closed in the 2DS scenario. This means that for the 2DS trajectories of price and volume provided, the corresponding cost structure of the coal sector (column of the IOT) is assumed different than the one in the BAU scenario. We will here not attempt to make an estimate of the more efficient technology of the coal-mining sector on the aggregate level that results from the closing of unprofitable coal-mines under 2DS. The matrix of technical coefficients is assumed the same under both scenarios. This means that the obtained measures of profitability under 2DS will be a low estimate, since too high costs are assumed.

%on output and employment per sector throughout the economy, the export volumes under both scenarios are evaluated under the BAU price. 
The actual demand scenarios used to estimate the effect of different export values in 2035 are as follows. For the BAU demand scenario, demand as in the South-african economy in the year 2014, as provided by the IOT, is used. As demand scenario for 2DS, the same as BAU is used with the sole difference that the volume of coal exports is determined such that the ratio of the BAU versus the 2DS volume is equal to the ratio of the volumes specified by CPI's scenarios.

%Denote $p_{E,coal}^{k,2035}$ and $q_{E,coal}^{k,2035}$, $k \in \{\mli{BAU}, \mli{2DS}\}$ the export prices and volumes of coal in the year 2035 for both scenarios. CPI projects export values of coal under respectively BAU and 2DS of $p_{E,coal}^{BAU,2035}\, q_{E,coal}^{BAU,2035}$ and $p_{E,coal}^{2DS,2035}\, q_{E,coal}^{2DS,2035}$. The values fed into the IO-model to determine the difference in output and employment induced per sector are however determined by the BAU price : $p_{E,coal}^{BAU,2035}\, q_{E,coal}^{BAU,2035}$ and $p_{E,coal}^{BAU,2035}\, q_{E,coal}^{2DS,2035}$. The remaining parts of the demand scenarios are as in 2014, as given by the 2014 IOT. 

The impact on employment between the two scenarios (with hypothetical inputs) can be found in table \ref{coalExport_BAUvs2DS_2035}. The top part of the table shows that the number of jobs in the coal sector under 2DS is about half that under BAU. The IO-model projects about 39 600 jobs in the coal sector under 2DS, which is in the same ballpark as CPI's estimate. Of this total number of jobs in coal mining, 15\% is generated by export and some consumption by households. The biggest share, 85\%, is generated by demand from other sectors. 

In addition, the reduction of the coal-mining sector also has an impact on economic activity in other sectors. %the IO analysis allows to make an estimate of the impact on other sectors due to . 
The estimate of this impact, as provided by the IO-model, is shown in the bottom part of table \ref{coalExport_BAUvs2DS_2035}. Over 40 000
jobs are lost throughout the economy, in addition to the job losses in coal-mining itself. Indeed, the amount of jobs lost in coul-mining is about the same as the amount lost throughout the economy, as could be deduced from the employment content analysis in figure \ref{Decomposition_direct_indirect_absolute}. The Transport sector is the first impacted because of the lost activity from transporting coal by rail. 

%The reason behind it is that the labour share is lower than on average in the economy and wages are higher than the average. Local demand for the output of the mining sectors 21, 23-24 is higher than the economy's average.

\subsubsection{Increase of the domestic coal-price}

\begin{figure}[!h]

	\hspace{-10pt}\includegraphics[width=1.1\textwidth]{../graphs/costPush_I4_10.pdf}
	\caption{\label{costPush_I4_10} The above graph shows the increase in the price of all sectors after a 10\% increase in the price of coal, assuming that the cost increase is entirely transferred, without affecting profitability of any of the sectors.}
\end{figure}


Due to the loss of cross-subsidies from coal-exports, which impacts the profitability of coal-mining, the domestic price of coal might increase to compensate. Domestically, coal is mainly purchased by industry as inputs (see figure \ref{Uses_Resources_percent_2014}). The lion's share is used for the generation of electricity (table \ref{4_Coal-and-lignite_IIusedBy}). It is expected that cost increases for the electricity provider would be transferred to the rest of the economy by increasing the it's price. Assuming that all sectors pass on the cost increase to their price, the cost-push IO-model (eqn. \ref{cost-push-scen}) allows to estimate how an increase in the domestic coal price impacts the prices of the output of all sectors. 

Figure \ref{costPush_I4_10} shows the increase in the price of all sectors after a 10\% increase in the price of coal. The resulting increase of the price of electricity is about 1,8\%.


\subsection{Electricity}

The electricity sector can be impacted in two ways by differences between a 2DS and BAU scenario. The increased cost of coal can be a source of a raise of electricity-tariffs. Secondly, the share of coal in the generation-mix might decrease.

\subsubsection{Reduced demand due to increase in electricity-price}

An increase in the price of electricity can imply reduced demand. Motivated by the last (two) decades or price evolution, several studies estimate aggregate and sectoral price-elasticities (\cite{inglesi2010forecasting} and \cite{goliger2018electricity}, references therein). 


\subsubsection{Change in the electricity generation-mix}

%To evaluate the effect of an increase of the price of coal on the price of electricity, 

%\subsubsection{Adapting IOT for different weight of coal in generation mix}
To evaluate the effect of a lower share of coal in the generation mix in 2DS versus BAU, a corresponding Leontief matrix needs to be constructed. 

To determine how the technical coefficients of sector SIC 41 evolve with different shares of coal, keeping the total volume of electricity generated constant, the coefficients are divided in three groups : the ones that are necessary for coal production, the ones that are necessary for one of the other technologies and the ones that are associated with both of the former groups. %The coefficients that are not in table \ref{GenerationMixcoefficients} are implicitly assumed to be independent of what technology generates 1 unit of electricity. In other words, the amount spent by sector SIC 41, as specified in the 2014 IOT table, for example on computer activities (SIC 86\&88), is determined by the total amount of $GWh$ of electricity produced in 2014, and not by what share was produced with coal. 
Table \label{GenerationMixcoefficients} specifies the dominant inputs of the electricity sector and to which of the three groups they are associated. The technical coefficients of the third group are divided in two shares, such that, calibrating all prices in the 2014 IOT to 1, the cost share of coal in te IOT is equal to the cost-share of coal as stated in the 2014 Integrated report from Eskom of the breakdown of the primary energy cost according to generation technology (68\%). Knowing that coal provided in 2014 90\% of $GWh$, then when the share of coal diminishes by a factor $1 - \lambda$, all the coefficients (and shares) associated with coal diminish with ($1-\lambda$) and the others with $1 + 90/10 \, \lambda$.

Because in 2014 coal is cheaper than the average of the other technologies, lower share of coal result in a higher generation cost.


\li{Construct elec technology with GTAP data}
%Future price evolutions of renewables ?


%in conjunction with knowledge of the amount of $GWh$ produced per technology over the year, a breakdown of the technical coefficients of electricity generation in the 2014 IOT can be obtained.  



%To evaluate the effect of a lower share of coal in the generation mix in 2DS versus BAU, it is necessary to know what the relative cost is of generating electricity from coal versus from other inputs. This can be estimated using the decomposition of the primary energy cost as given by Eskom's 2014 annual report \citep{Eskom2014AR}, given in table \ref{EskomPrimaryEnergy}. 


%To construct the corresponding matrix, first the technical coefficients that reflect the generation mix need to be identified. Secondly, a quantitative estimate has to be made on how the coefficients evolve to reflect different generation mixes.
%
%The technical coefficients that catch the generation mix are found in the column of sector SIC 41, Electricity, gas and water of the matrix, which contains the inputs necessary to generate electricity. As shown in table \ref{SIC41composition}, sector SIC 41 contains also the manufacture of gas and steam ad hot water supply ; however electricity generation is the biggest share of activity (xx\% ?). The relevant entries are listed in table \ref{GenerationMixcoefficients}. The main aspect under investigation of the generation mix is a reduced share of coal. Thus, if less coal is used to generate 1 unit of electricity, a hypothesis has to be made on what other production technology would replace coal. %In order to avoid making heuristic assumptions on this issue, 
%It is assumed that all the other production technologies take up the slack in equal parts, proportional to the share they provide as reflected in the IOT for the year 2014. Thus, the technical coefficients of sector SIC 41 that reflect the generation mix are divided in three groups : the ones that are necessary for coal production and the ones that are necessary for one of the other technologies. The coefficients that are not in table \ref{GenerationMixcoefficients} are implicitly assumed to be independent of through what generation technology 1 unit of electricity is produced. In other words, the amount spent by sector SIC 41, as specified in the 2014 IOT table, for example on computer activities (SIC 86\&88), is determined by the total amount of $MWh$ of electricity produced in 2014, and not by what share was produced with coal. The input of the Electricity, gas and water supply to itself contains subsectors --- listed in table \ref{SIC41composition} --- who's shares in total cost are assumed independent of technology, such as the distribution of electricity (SIC 41111), and shares that are assumed proportional to the primary energy inputs used for generation through non-coal technologies, such as Gas and Generation. The latter subsector reflects both electricity produced by IPP's as well as by coal-fired plants as by the Koeberg nuclear station or any other of Eskom's generation plants. For simplicity, we will assume the input of SIC 41 to itself independent of generation mix.

%Given Z the IO matrix of inter-industry sales in current prices of the SA economy. The technical coefficients for the electricity sector reflect the particular generation mix of the year for which the matrix is made. To evaluate the effect on the economy of a slightly different generation mix, with the same production of electricity in $MWh$, with possibly different prices, we need to know which of the IO entries will be affected and determine for the relevant coefficients their volume / price ratio. We need to know, when 10\% less coal is used for electricity generation, what coefficients need to increase, and by what percentage, to generate the same final $MWh$. Identifying the relevant coefficients is a question of identifying the place and role of each of the inputs in the production process. Once this is established, to determine by what percentage they need to increase, for the coefficients that represent primary energy inputs that can be interpreted to correspond to the data given in table \ref{EskomPrimaryEnergy}, an estimate is made as follows : .

y_i + m_i - d_i^m= \sum_j \big(z_{ij}^d + z_{ij}^m \big) + d_i^d, 
\end{equation}
where $d^r = c^r_i + g_i^r + i_i^r + inv_i^r + x_i^r$ , $r\in\{d,m\}$ denote final demand for domestically produced goods and services and for imported goods. The aggregates $m_i - d_i^m$ are the imports used as intermediate inputs, or differently put, the importation needed for domestic production.

We are interested in, given a final demand vector for domestically produced goods $\boldsymbol{d}^d$, not only how much domestic production this entails, but also how much importation this generates because of the use of imported goods as intermediate inputs. To this end, we define modified matrices of technical coefficients $\tilde{A}^r$ as the matrices with elements $\tilde{a}^r_{ij}$ : 
\begin{align}
\tilde{a}^r_{ij} = \frac{z_{ij}^r}{y_i + m_i - d_i^m} \label{defAtilde}
\end{align}
These matrices tell us how much intermediary inputs, respectively of domestic and of imported origin, are needed per unit of domestic output and imported intermediate goods. Additionally, we define the technical coefficients matrix $\tilde{A}= \tilde{A}^d + \tilde{A}^m$ that states the total intermediary inputs, of any origin, per unit of imports + domestic output.

%We then define the matrices $Y$ and $M_{int}$ such that :

Given $D^d$ the matrix with demand $d^d$ on the diagonal and 0's elsewher, we then define the matrix $\mli{YM}$ as :
\begin{equation}
\mli{YM} = (\mathbb{I} - \tilde{A})^{-1} \, D^d \label{YM}
\end{equation}
The element $ym_{ij}$ of $\mli{YM}$ is the sum of domestic production and imported intermediate goods of sector $i$ needed to satisfy final demand by sector j $d_j^d$.

\li{The column sums of $M_{int}$ are the same as the column sums of $Z^m$, but are the two matrices the same ?}

We now want to split matrix $\mli{YM}$ up into domestic output and intermediate inputs that were imported.

For this we will decompose the factor that is analogous to the Leontief inverse :

\begin{align}
(\mathbb{I} - \tilde{A})^{-1} &= (\mathbb{I} - \tilde{A}^d - \tilde{A}^m)^{-1} \nonumber \\
&= (\mathbb{I} - \tilde{A}^d)^{-1} + (\mathbb{I} - \tilde{A}^m)^{-1} - \mathbb{I} + rest \label{decomp1}
\end{align}

The first term on the right hand side measures domestic output necessary to satisfy demand $D^d$. We take a closer look at the second and third terms at the right-hand side of  \ref{decomp1} by developing the power series : 
\begin{equation}
(\mathbb{I} - \tilde{A}^m)^{-1} - \mathbb{I} = \sum_{k=1}^{+\infty}  (\tilde{A}^m)^k  \label{importedInputsneeded}
\end{equation}
Whereas the significance of $\tilde{A}^m D^d$ is quite clear --- it determines the imported intermediate inputs needed to satisfy domestically produced final demand, the meaning of the following terms $(\tilde{A}^m)^k D^d$ with $k>1$ seems nebulous when interpreted along the same line. This line of interpretation looks at the matrix $\tilde{A}^m D^d$ row-wise : we seek an answer to the question how much output from each sector is needed to satisfy the demanded production from other sectors. In this case, the "output from each sector needed" are imported goods. The term $\tilde{A}^m \tilde{A}^m D^d$ does not make sense in this interpretation : what are the import needed to generate the imports ? Rather, one can think of $\tilde{A}^m D^d$ column-wise and interpret each element $a^m_{ij}\,d^d_j$as a contribution to the cost of producing a good $j$, or a contribution to the value of the good $j$ by using the intermediate input $i$, obtained through importation. Then, $\tilde{A}^m \tilde{A}^m D^d$ also takes on a clear significance : it represents the value generated indirectly by using imported intermediate inputs to %generate value by 
produce output that was produced with imported inputs. 
%Instead of thinking in terms of the output of sector $i$ needed to satisfy demand from sector $j$, think of it vice-versa : it is the value of output of sector $j$ originating from using input $i$. Of course, a single input cannot produce a good. This is why the former sentence contains "value of". Using input $i$ contributes to the cost of production or to the value of good $j$. 

Why would one determine how much imported goods are needed to import goods ? 

To able to create the value generated by using imported inputs, a certain amount of imported inputs are needed, etc.
Beware, is is using the imported inputs that creates value domestically ; producing obviously doesn't.

It is now clear that the terms \ref{importedInputsneeded} contribute to the amount of imported goods needed to satisfy domestically produced final demand. The terms in the $rest$ term contain both $\tilde{A}^d$ and $\tilde{A}^m$ factors. For example $\tilde{A}^m \tilde{A}^d D^d$ represents the value generated by using imported goods to produce the intermediate inputs necessary for the production of the intermediate inputs $\tilde{A}^d D^d$, where this last term can be worded as the value created by using locally produced inputs to produce demand $D^d$.

The rest term is known, given by $$ rest =(\mathbb{I} - \tilde{A})^{-1} - (\mathbb{I} - \tilde{A}^d)^{-1} - (\mathbb{I} - \tilde{A}^m)^{-1} + \mathbb{I}.$$
It contains both value created by using imported and domestically produced inputs and will her be roughly split up according to the last step in the production process :
$$
rest = \tilde{A}^d (\tilde{A}^m + T) + \tilde{A}^m(\tilde{A}^d + T)
$$
The first term on the right-hand side is counted as domestic production and the second term as imports. (The second term are all the imports needed/used to produce the intermediary inputs --- direct inputs and the chain of indirect inputs --- that have been produced using both imported and domestic inputs.)

The unknown tail $T$ is easily determined : $$ T = ( \tilde{A}^d +  \tilde{A}^m)^{-1}\, ( \tilde{A}^m  \tilde{A}^d +  \tilde{A}^d \tilde{A}^m)$$
Matrix $\mli{LM}$ as given in eqn. \ref{YM} is then split up as :
\begin{align}
\tilde{Y} &= (\mathbb{I} - \tilde{A}^d)^{-1} \, D^d + \tilde{A}^d \big(\tilde{A}^m +  ( \tilde{A}^d +  \tilde{A}^m)^{-1}\, ( \tilde{A}^m  \tilde{A}^d +  \tilde{A}^d \tilde{A}^m)\big) \, D^d \\
\tilde{M} &= (\mathbb{I} - \tilde{A}^m)^{-1} \, D^d - \mathbb{I} + \tilde{A}^m \big(\tilde{A}^d +  ( \tilde{A}^d +  \tilde{A}^m)^{-1}\, ( \tilde{A}^m  \tilde{A}^d +  \tilde{A}^d \tilde{A}^m)\big) \, D^d
\end{align}


%The value created by producing a product is the value of the product. The value of using the product as intermediate input is 

%To resolve this issue, we determine the relationship between $\tilde{A}^m$ and $A^m$, where the latter is the technical coefficients matrix for imported goods, defined as usual. Starting from \ref{defAtilde} in matrix notation :

%\begin{align}
%\tilde{A}^m &= Z^m \, (diag(\boldsymbol{y + m - d^m}) )^{-1} \nonumber\\
%&=  Z^m \, (diag(\boldsymbol{y}))^{-1} \, \big( \mathbb{I} +  (diag(\boldsymbol{y}))^{-1} \, diag(\boldsymbol{m - d^m})   \big)^{-1} \nonumber\\
%&= Z^m \, (diag(\boldsymbol{y}))^{-1} \, \sum_{k=0}^{+\infty} \big(-(diag(\boldsymbol{y}))^{-1} \, diag(\boldsymbol{m - d^m})\big)^k \nonumber\\
%&= A^m  \, \sum_{k=0}^{+\infty} \big(-(diag(\boldsymbol{y}))^{-1} \, diag(\boldsymbol{m - d^m})\big)^k
%\end{align}
